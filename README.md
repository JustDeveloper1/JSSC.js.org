# JSSC — JavaScript String Compressor <Badge type="tip" text="2.0.0" />
**JSSC (JavaScript String Compressor)** is an open-source, **lossless string compression algorithm** designed specifically for JavaScript.

It operates directly on JavaScript strings (UTF-16) and produces compressed data that is also a valid JavaScript string.

JSSC is distributed as a **UMD module** and can be used in browsers, Node.js, Deno, and other JavaScript environments.
