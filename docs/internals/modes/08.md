# Compression Mode `08` — URL <Badge type="tip" text="since v2.0.0" />

This compression mode is optimized for compressing **URLs**.

It encodes the URL as a compact byte stream instead of regular UTF-16 characters, preserving the original URL exactly.

## How It Works

1. Percent-encoded sequences (`%XX`) are decoded into raw bytes.
2. All remaining characters are converted into UTF-16 code units.
3. The resulting byte stream is packed into UTF-16 characters.

The compressed output contains only the encoded URL payload.
